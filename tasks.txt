Hello and welcome to our test!
You can run the application with the command 'yarn start'

*** Task 1 ***

There ist a modal component (ChangeCardSetModal.jsx) which should open a modal when the user clicks the 'Current card set' button.
The component is already there you just have to add it to the marked space in the Game.jsx file
You only have to add the component and give it the right properties. All the properties are already there,
you don't have to add something on your own (Game.jsx)

*** Task 2 ***

Implement a async function and use the fetch api or axios to get data from the starwars api (the url is already there)
After the data is fetched call the 'dealCards' function with the results and set loading to false (useCards.jsx)

*** Task 3 ***

Add some styling for the card component and its table to the Card.css file.
The Component should look like the screenshot picture in the public folder.
If the user selects a property from the card the property should be highlighted in yellow.
(Card.css)

*** Task 4 ***
Implement the game logic by immutable updating the state depending on who won the current round.
You find tips to the logic in the code (useCards.jsx). The current cards for player and computer
are stored in the player and computer state.

*** Task 5 ***
A admin area should be implemented with the help of redux. In the admin directory there is already a
component which is reachable via '/admin'. The redux store is also there and you should now create a
simple table component to display the initial data from the store

*** Task 6 ***
Add the opportunity to delete one of the elements using redux. Update your form first and add
a confirmation popup. Then update the store based on the dispatched delete action.
